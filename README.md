# My Python Learning Journey üêç

This repository serves as a personal log and showcase of my progress in learning Python programming and foundational data analytics. As an aspiring Technical Operations Analyst and AI/AML Data Specialist, I'm committed to building a strong technical foundation and applying my skills to real-world problems.

Here, you'll find:
* My solutions to exercises from various online courses.
* Small practice scripts and coding challenges.
* Early explorations with core Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
* (Eventually) Preparatory work or small components that might feed into larger projects.
